Come up with your very best ideas for improving the Prompts in our registry.

You may suggest new ones, edit old ones, etc.

You must deeply understand the project context (and how projects relate). Then suggest human and robot prompts for better results.

Think hard and generate an abundance of **already-good** ideas (15+) (brief one-liner for each).

Then go through each one systematically and critically evaluate it, rejecting the ones that are not excellent choices for good reasons and keeping the ones that pass your scrutiny.

Then, for each idea that passed your test, explain in detail exactly what the idea is (in the form of a concrete, specific, actionable plan with detailed code snippets where relevant), why it would be a good improvement, what are the possible downsides, and how confident you are that it actually improves the project (0-100%). Make sure to actually implement the top ideas now.

Use ultrathink.
