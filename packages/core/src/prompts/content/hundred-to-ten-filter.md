I want you to come up with your top 10 most brilliant ideas for adding extremely powerful and cool functionality that will make this system far more compelling, useful, intuitive, versatile, powerful, robust, reliable, etc. Use ultrathink. But be pragmatic and don't think of features that will be extremely hard to implement or which aren't necessarily worth the additional complexity burden they would introduce. But I don't want you to just think of 10 ideas: I want you to seriously think hard and come up with one HUNDRED ideas and then only tell me your 10 VERY BEST and most brilliant, clever, and radically innovative and powerful ideas.
