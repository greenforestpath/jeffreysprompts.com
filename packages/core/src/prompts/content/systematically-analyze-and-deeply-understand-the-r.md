This is my first time using this prompt.
  Can you create yourself a
  sandbox_experiment_folder and do this
  task? essentially look at both repos,
  create whatever artifacts are necessary
  then finally some diagrams . loop me in
  when you "need something from me"

Systematically analyze and deeply understand the repositories and then draw a "diagrams as code". You  may products artifacts(codemaps, file references, indices) and MAPS before you draw the diagrams so you don't miss anything.


For reference(i used to use eraser.io(an ai diagram) but I no longer have subscription). They had various diagrams depending on the situation like:


<types of diagrams>
Flow Charts: Visualize process flows, user flows, logic flows
Entity Relationship Diagrams: Visualize data models
Cloud Architecture Diagrams: Visualize cloud infrastructure and data flow
Sequence Diagrams: Visualize system flows and interactions
</types of diagrams>

Map it using "diagram-agnostic" artifacts and THEN do the diagrams and whatever makes most sense.
