I want you to do a spectacular job building absolutely world-class UI/UX components, with an intense focus on making the most visually appealing, user-friendly, intuitive, slick, polished, "Stripe level" of quality UI/UX possible for this that leverages the good libraries that are already part of the project. Use ultrathink.
