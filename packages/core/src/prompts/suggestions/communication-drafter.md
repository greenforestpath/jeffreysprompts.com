Draft professional, human-sounding communication for the specified purpose.

## Communication Types

**For PR Descriptions:**
- Summary of what changed and why
- Testing done
- Screenshots if UI changes
- Breaking changes or migration notes

**For Commit Messages:**
- Follow conventional commits format
- First line: type(scope): brief description
- Body: explain why, not what (code shows what)

**For Emails/Messages:**
- Clear subject line
- Context first, ask/action second
- Bullet points for multiple items
- Explicit next steps or asks

**For Release Notes:**
- User-facing changes only
- Grouped by type (features, fixes, breaking)
- Link to relevant docs/PRs

## Writing Rules

1. **No AI-slop patterns:**
   - Avoid em dashes (use semicolons or commas)
   - No "Here's why" or "Here's the thing"
   - No "It's not X, it's Y" constructions
   - No excessive hedging or qualifiers

2. **Be direct:**
   - State the main point first
   - Use active voice
   - Keep sentences short

3. **Match the context:**
   - Technical detail for technical audiences
   - Plain language for stakeholders
   - Appropriate formality for the medium

## Output

The communication text, ready to use. If you need clarification about audience or context, ask first.
